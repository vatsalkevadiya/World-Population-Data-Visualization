## Project Overview

Data visualization is an effective way to represent information visually and can help in making complex data more understandable. In this project, we've used D3.js to create two types of diagrams: a bar chart and a pie chart.

### Bar Chart
The bar chart displays data in a series of horizontal bars, each representing a different category or item. The width of each bar corresponds to the value it represents. This type of chart is great for comparing values across different categories.

### Pie Chart
The pie chart displays data in a circular graph, with each "slice" of the pie representing a different category or item. The size of each slice is proportional to the value it represents. Pie charts are useful for showing the parts of a whole and the relationships between them.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: The project's structure and content are defined using HTML.
- CSS: Styles and layout for the project are created using CSS.
- JavaScript: Interactivity and data manipulation are handled using JavaScript.
- D3.js: A JavaScript library that is used for creating data visualizations.

## Project Structure

The project structure is quite straightforward. Here's a quick overview:

```bash
data-visualization-project/
│
├── index.html # The main HTML file for the project
│
├── styles.css # CSS file for styling the project
│
├── script.js # JavaScript file for creating the data visualizations using D3.js
│
├── data/ # Folder containing sample data for the charts
│ ├── population_by_country_2020.csv # Data for charts
│
└── images/ # Folder for storing project images
```


## Usage

To run the project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You will see both the bar chart and pie chart displaying sample data. You can modify the data in the `data` folder to visualize your own data.

Feel free to explore and interact with the charts. Hover over data points to see tooltips, and enjoy the interactivity that D3.js provides.
